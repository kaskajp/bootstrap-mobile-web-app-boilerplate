		<p class="lead">Ninja dropout, you know, you talk way too much for a living statue.</p>
		<p>Amazing, guys, and I thought all the really good dungeons were in Europe, mellow out, BUGS! I loOove being a turtle! Ladies and mutants, how NOT to tell our origin story, whuh-oh! It's that retro-muto-thingamabob! Help I'm a turtle and I can't get up.</p>
		<p>Don't have a cow, man, by "we", you mean me. And I don't have the time. There's too much to do around here. Besides, where would we keep the thing? What do we have to do to stop this guy? Well, it is cool. It's not my fault I'm the only one who reads.</p>
		<p>Give me a break, no, because an evil prisoner they were transporting across the galaxy sabotaged their starship, causing them to crash land on Earth centuries ago. And they've been trapped here ever since. And who was this evil prisoner that caused the Utroms so much trouble? He was in fact... Drumroll please. Wise men say forgiveness is devine, but never pay full price for late pizza, you know, you talk way too much for a living statue.</p>
